# The-Odin-Project-01
# Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes is a simple web project to showcase your favorite recipes. The project is structured into iterations, with each iteration building on the previous one.

## Iteration 1: Initial Structure

In the first iteration, we set up the basic project structure:

- Created an `index.html` file with boilerplate HTML.
- Added an `<h1>` heading "Odin Recipes."

## Iteration 2: Recipe Page

In the second iteration, we started creating recipe pages:

- Created a `recipes` directory to store individual recipe pages.
- Added an HTML file for a recipe (e.g., `lasagna.html`) with an `<h1>` heading containing the recipe's name.
- Linked the recipe page from the `index.html` file.

## Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content

In the third iteration, we added content to the recipe pages:

- Included an image of the finished dish.
- Added a "Description" section with a brief description of the recipe.
- Included an "Ingredients" section with an unordered list.
- Added a "Steps" section with an ordered list of the cooking steps.

## Iteration 4: Adding More Recipes

In the fourth iteration, we expanded the project with more recipes:

- Added two additional recipe pages with the same page structure as the initial recipe page.
- Linked to the new recipes from the `index.html` file, organized within an unordered list.

Feel free to customize and expand the project further with your favorite recipes.
